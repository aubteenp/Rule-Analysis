Food Labeling; Gluten-Free Labeling of Fermented or Hydrolyzed Foods,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is issuing a final rule to establish requirements concerning ""gluten-free"" labeling for foods that are fermented or hydrolyzed or that contain fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients. These requirements f are needed to help ensure that individuals with celiac disease are not misled and receive truthful and accurate information with respect to fermented or hydrolyzed foods labeled as ""gluten- free."" Currently, FDA knows of no scientifically valid analytical method effective in detecting and quantifying with precision the gluten protein content in fermented or hydrolyzed foods in terms of equivalent amounts of intact gluten proteins. Thus, we plan to evaluate compliance of such fermented or hydrolyzed foods that bear a ""gluten-free"" claim based on records that are made and kept by the manufacturer of the food bearing the ""gluten-free"" claim and made available to us for inspection and copying. The records need to provide adequate assurance that the food or ingredients used in the food are ""gluten-free"" before fermentation or hydrolysis. Once we identify that a scientifically valid method has been developed that can accurately detect and quantify gluten in fermented or hydrolyzed foods or ingredients, it would no longer be necessary for the manufacturer of foods bearing the ""gluten-free"" claim to make and keep these records. In addition, because currently there is no scientifically valid analytical method effective in detecting and quantifying the gluten protein content in fermented or hydrolyzed foods the final rule requires the manufacturer of these kinds of foods bearing the ""gluten- free"" claim to document that it has adequately evaluated the potential for gluten cross-contact and, if identified, that the manufacturer has implemented measures to prevent the introduction of gluten into the food during the manufacturing process. Likewise, the final rule requires manufacturers of foods that contain fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients and bear the ""gluten-free"" claim to make and keep records that demonstrate with adequate assurance that the fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients are ""gluten-free"" in compliance with the 2013 gluten-free food labeling final rule. Finally, this final rule states that we will evaluate compliance of distilled foods by verifying the absence of protein using scientifically valid analytical methods that can reliably detect the presence of protein or protein fragments in the distilled food.",85 FR 49240, 2020-17088,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/13/2020-17088/food-labeling-gluten-free-labeling-of-fermented-or-hydrolyzed-foods,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-08-13/pdf/2020-17088.pdf,8/13/2020

A membrane lung device for long-term pulmonary support (>6 hours) refers to the oxygenator in an extracorporeal circuit used during long-term procedures, commonly referred to as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Because a number of other devices and accessories are used with the oxygenator in the circuit, the title and identification of the regulation are revised to include extracorporeal circuit and accessories for long-term respiratory/cardiopulmonary failure. Although an individual device or accessory used in an ECMO circuit may already have its own classification regulation when the device or accessory is intended for short-term use (<=6 hours), such device or accessory will be subject to the same regulatory controls applied to the oxygenator (i.e., class II, special controls) when evaluated as part of the ECMO circuit for long- term use (>6 hours).
