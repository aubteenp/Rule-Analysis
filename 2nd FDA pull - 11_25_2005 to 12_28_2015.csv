A food that bears the claim ""no gluten,"" ""free of gluten,"" or ""without gluten"" in its labeling and fails to meet the requirements for a ""gluten-free"" claim will be deemed to be misbranded. In addition, a food whose labeling includes the term ""wheat"" in the ingredient list or in a separate ""Contains wheat"" statement as required by a section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and also bears the claim ""gluten-free"" will be deemed to be misbranded unless its labeling also bears additional language clarifying that the wheat has been processed to allow the food to meet FDA requirements for a ""gluten-free"" claim. Establishing a definition of the term ""gluten-free"" and uniform conditions for its use in food labeling will help ensure that individuals with celiac disease are not misled and are provided with truthful and accurate information with respect to foods so labeled.

Such collections may be at increased risk of transmitting HCV infection. FDA is requiring collecting establishments to quarantine prior in-date blood and blood components from such a donor, to notify consignees of prior in-date blood and blood components from such a donor for quarantine purposes, and to perform further testing on the donor. FDA is also requiring consignees to notify transfusion recipients of blood and blood components from such a donor, as appropriate.

Revocation of Status of Specific Products; Group A Streptococcus,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is removing the regulation applicable to the status of specific products; Group A streptococcus. FDA is removing the regulation because the existing requirement for Group A streptococcus organisms and derivatives is both obsolete and a perceived impediment to the development of Group A streptococcus vaccines. The regulation was written to apply to a group of products that are no longer on the market. We are taking this action as part of our continuing effort to reduce the burden of unnecessary regulations on industry and to revise outdated regulations without diminishing public health protection. We are issuing the removal directly as a final rule because it is noncontroversial, and there is little likelihood that we will receive any significant adverse comments. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, we are publishing a companion proposed rule under our usual procedures for notice and comment in the event that we receive any significant adverse comments on the direct final rule. If we receive any significant adverse comments that warrant terminating the direct final rule, we will consider such comments on the proposed rule in developing the final rule.",70 FR 72197, 05-23546,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/12/02/05-23546/revocation-of-status-of-specific-products-group-a-streptococcus,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2005-12-02/pdf/05-23546.pdf,12/2/2005
