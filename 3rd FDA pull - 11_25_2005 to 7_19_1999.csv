"Food Labeling; Nutrient Content Claims, Definition of Sodium Levels for the Term “Healthy”",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations concerning the maximum sodium levels permitted for foods that bear the implied nutrient content claim ""healthy."" The agency is retaining the currently effective, less restrictive, ""first-tier"" sodium level requirements for all food categories, including individual foods (480 milligrams (mg)) and meals and main dishes (600 mg), and is dropping the ""second-tier"" (more restrictive) sodium level requirements for all food categories. Based on the comments received about technological barriers to reducing sodium in processed foods and poor sales of products that meet the second-tier sodium level, the agency has determined that requiring the more restrictive sodium levels would likely inhibit the development of new ""healthy"" food products and risk substantially eliminating existing ""healthy"" products from the marketplace. After reviewing the comments and evaluating the data from various sources, FDA has become convinced that retaining the higher first-tier sodium level requirements for all food products bearing the term ""healthy"" will encourage the manufacture of a greater number of products that are consistent with dietary guidelines for a variety of nutrients. The agency has also revised the regulatory text of the ""healthy"" regulation to clarify the scope and meaning of the regulation and to reformat the nutrient content requirements for ""healthy"" into a more readable set of tables, consistent with the Presidential Memorandum instructing that regulations be written in plain language.",70 FR 56828, 05-19511,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/09/29/05-19511/food-labeling-nutrient-content-claims-definition-of-sodium-levels-for-the-term-healthy,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2005-09-29/pdf/05-19511.pdf,9/29/2005

In the July 14, 2004, interim final rule, FDA designated certain materials from cattle, including the entire small intestine, as ""prohibited cattle materials"" and banned the use of such materials in human food, including dietary supplements, and in cosmetics. FDA is taking this action in response to comments received on the interim final rule. Information was provided in comments that persuaded the agency that the distal ileum, one of three portions of the small intestine, could be consistently and effectively removed from the small intestine, such that the remainder of the small intestine, formerly a prohibited cattle material, could be used for human food or cosmetics. We (FDA) are also clarifying that milk and milk products, hide and hide-derived products, and tallow derivatives are not prohibited cattle materials. Comments also led the agency to reconsider the method cited in the interim final rule for determining insoluble impurities in tallow and to cite instead a method that is less costly to use and requires less specialized equipment. FDA issued the interim final rule to minimize human exposure to materials that scientific studies have demonstrated are highly likely to contain the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent in cattle infected with the disease.

"Medical Devices; Labeling for Menstrual Tampons; Ranges of Absorbency, Change From “Junior” to “Light”",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule that amends its menstrual tampon labeling regulation to change the current term for tampons that absorb 6 grams (g) and under of fluid. A tampon with absorbency of 6 g or less is currently required to be labeled as ""junior"". FDA is changing the term ""junior"" to ""light"". The term ""junior"" implies that the tampon is only for younger or teenage women when, in fact, it may be appropriate for women of any age with light menstrual flow. FDA encourages women to use the lowest absorbency tampon appropriate for their flow to help minimize the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). At present, FDA requires standardized terms to be used for the labeling of a menstrual tampon to indicate its particular absorbency. This rule enables women to compare the absorbency of one brand and style of tampons with the absorbency of other brands and styles. FDA is issuing this final rule under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to ensure that labeling of menstrual tampons is not misleading.",69 FR 52170, 04-19488,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/08/25/04-19488/medical-devices-labeling-for-menstrual-tampons-ranges-of-absorbency-change-from-junior-to-light,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-08-25/pdf/04-19488.pdf,8/25/2004

Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an interim final rule (interim final rule) to prohibit the use of certain cattle material, to address the potential risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in human food, including dietary supplements, and cosmetics. Prohibited cattle materials include specified risk materials, small intestine of all cattle, material from nonambulatory disabled cattle, material from cattle not inspected and passed for human consumption, and mechanically separated (MS)(Beef). Specified risk materials are the brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column (excluding the vertebrae of the tail, the transverse processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, and the wings of the sacrum), and dorsal root ganglia of cattle 30 months and older; and the tonsils and distal ileum of the small intestine of all cattle. Prohibited cattle materials do not include tallow that contains no more than 0.15 percent hexane-insoluble impurities and tallow derivatives. FDA is taking this action in response to the finding of an adult cow, imported from Canada, that tested positive for BSE in the State of Washington. This action is consistent with the recent interim final rule issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) declaring specified risk materials and the carcasses and parts of nonambulatory disabled cattle to be inedible, unfit for human food, and prohibiting their use as human food and requiring that the entire small intestine be removed and disposed of as inedible. This action will minimize human exposure to materials that scientific studies have demonstrated are highly likely to contain the BSE agent in cattle infected with the disease. Scientists believe that the human disease variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is likely caused by the consumption of products contaminated with the agent that causes BSE.

"Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987; Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992; Policies, Requirements, and Administrative Procedures; Delay of Effective Date",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is further delaying, until December 1, 2006, the effective date of certain requirements of a final rule published in the Federal Register of December 3, 1999 (64 FR 67720). In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of certain requirements in the final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. The agency further delayed the effective date of these requirements in three subsequent Federal Register notices. Most recently, in the Federal Register of January 31, 2003 (68 FR 4912), FDA delayed the effective date until April 1, 2004. This action further delays the effective date of these requirements until December 1, 2006. The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements in the final rule raised by affected parties. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, FDA is working with stakeholders through its counterfeit drug initiative to facilitate widespread, voluntary adoption of track and trace technologies that will generate a de facto electronic pedigree, including prior transaction history back to the original manufacturer, as a routine course of business. If this technology is widely adopted, it is expected to help fulfill the pedigree requirements of the PDMA and obviate or resolve many of the concerns that have been raised with respect to the final rule by ensuring that an electronic pedigree travels with a drug product at all times. Therefore, it is necessary to delay the effective date of Sec. Sec. 203.3(u) and 203.50 (21 CFR 203.3(u) and 203.50) until December 1, 2007 to allow stakeholders time to continue to move toward this goal. In addition, the further delay of the applicability of Sec. 203.3(q) to wholesale distribution of blood derivatives by health care entities is necessary to give the agency additional time to consider whether regulatory changes are appropriate and, if so, to initiate such changes.",69 FR 8105, 04-3856,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/02/23/04-3856/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-02-23/pdf/04-3856.pdf,2/23/2004

In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of certain requirements in the final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. The agency further delayed the effective date of these requirements in two subsequent Federal Register documents. Most recently, in the Federal Register of February 13, 2002 (67 FR 6645), FDA delayed the effective date until April 1, 2003. This action further delays the effective date of these requirements until April 1, 2004. The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements raised by affected parties. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, FDA has prepared a report for Congress and concluded that although FDA can address some of industry's concerns with the PDMA regulation through regulatory changes, other concerns would have to be addressed by Congress through legislative action. The further delay is necessary to give Congress additional time to consider the information and conclusions contained in the agency's report, and to determine if legislative action is appropriate. The further delay will also give the agency additional time to consider whether regulatory changes are appropriate and, if so, to initiate such changes.",68 FR 4912, 03-2293,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/01/31/03-2293/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-01-31/pdf/03-2293.pdf,1/31/2003

Food Labeling: Health Claims; D-tagatose and Dental Caries,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulation authorizing a health claim on sugar alcohols and dental caries, i.e., tooth decay, to include the sugar D-tagatose, a novel food ingredient. Similar to the sugar alcohols currently listed in Sec. 101.80 (21 CFR 101.80), D-tagatose is a carbohydrate sweetener that is slowly fermented by oral microorganisms, thus producing less acid than more fermentable carbohydrates. We (FDA) are taking this action in response to a petition filed by Arla Foods Ingredients amba. We previously concluded that there was significant scientific agreement for the relationship between slowly fermented carbohydrate sugar substitutes, specifically certain sugar alcohols, and the nonpromotion of dental caries. Based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, we now have determined that the sugar D-tagatose, like the sugar alcohols, is not fermented by oral bacteria to an extent sufficient to lower dental plaque pH to levels that would cause the erosion of dental enamel. Therefore, we have concluded that D-tagatose does not promote dental caries, and we are amending the regulation authorizing a health claim relating certain sugar alcohols and nonpromotion of dental caries to include D-tagatose as a substance eligible for the claim. Moreover, because D-tagatose is a sugar, we are denying the petitioner's request to exclude D-tagatose from the definition of ""sugars,"" and instead are exempting foods containing D- tagatose from the requirement that foods bearing a health claim about nonpromotion of dental caries be sugar-free. Accordingly, although products containing D-tagatose will not be permitted to be labeled as ""sugar-free,"" they will be authorized to say that D-tagatose sugar does not promote, or may reduce the risk of, tooth decay.",67 FR 71461, 02-30474,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/12/02/02-30474/food-labeling-health-claims-d-tagatose-and-dental-caries,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2002-12-02/pdf/02-30474.pdf,12/2/2002

In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of certain requirements in the final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. In the Federal Register of March 1, 2001 (66 FR 12850), the agency further delayed the effective date of those requirements until April 1, 2002.

As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, the delay will allow additional time for Congress and FDA to consider whether legislative and regulatory changes are appropriate. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, FDA has prepared a report for Congress and concluded that although the agency can address some of industry's concerns with the PDMA regulation through regulatory changes, other concerns would have to be addressed by Congress through legislative action. The further delay is necessary to give Congress time to consider the information and conclusions contained in the agency's report, and to determine if legislative action is appropriate. The further delay will also give the agency additional time to consider whether regulatory changes are appropriate and, if so, to initiate such changes.",67 FR 6645, 02-3282,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/02/13/02-3282/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2002-02-13/pdf/02-3282.pdf,2/13/2002

"Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987; Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992; Policies, Requirements, and Administrative Procedures; Delay of Effective Date",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is further delaying, until April 1, 2002, the effective date regarding certain requirements of the final rule published in the Federal Register of December 3, 1999 (64 FR 67720). The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). FDA is further delaying the effective date for certain requirements in the PDMA final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency previously delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of these requirements. The other provisions of the final rule became effective on December 4, 2000. The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements raised by affected parties. FDA believes that this further delay of the effective date of certain requirements in the PDMA final rule satisfies the memorandum of January 20, 2001, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled ""Regulatory Review Plan,"" published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2001 (66 FR 7702). That memorandum requested Federal agencies to delay by 60 days the effective date of any regulation that was not effective as of January 20, 2001. The action taken in this document to further delay the effective date of certain requirements of PDMA exceeds 60 days. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section entitled ""Need to Further Delay the Effective Date,"" the delay will give distributors additional time to exhaust inventories of drugs that do not have acceptable pedigrees to avoid economic harm. Additionally, the delay will allow more time for FDA to make recommendations to Congress, for Congress to evaluate those recommendations and, if necessary, time for a regulatory or legislative change.",66 FR 12850, 01-4964,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/03/01/01-4964/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-03-01/pdf/01-4964.pdf,3/1/2001
