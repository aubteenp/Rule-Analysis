Natural Rubber-Containing Medical Devices; User Labeling,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is providing notice that it does not intend to apply to combination products currently regulated under human drug or biologic labeling provisions its September 30, 1997, final rule requiring certain labeling statements for all medical devices that contain or have packaging that contains natural rubber that contacts humans. FDA is taking this action, in part, in response to a citizen petition and other communications from industry that the agency has received since the publication of the final rule. FDA intends to initiate a proceeding to propose natural rubber labeling requirements for drugs and biologics, including combination products that are currently regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions. Such a proceeding may include a combination of rulemaking and guidance and will offer opportunity for public comment. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 30, 1998. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian L. Pendleton, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD- 7), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-594-5649; or Robert A. Yetter, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM-10), Food and Drug Administration, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, 301-827-0737. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 30, 1997 (62 FR 51021), FDA published a final rule to be codified at 21 CFR 801.437 requiring certain labeling statements on medical devices that contain or have packaging that contains natural rubber that contacts humans. The labeling statements alert users that a product contains either dry natural rubber or natural rubber latex, and for products containing natural rubber latex that the presence of this material may cause allergic reactions. The final rule, which becomes effective September 30, 1998, was adopted because natural rubber may cause a significant health risk to persons who are sensitized to natural latex proteins. In response to a comment on the proposed latex labeling regulation (61 FR 32618, June 24, 1996) about the applicability of the requirements to combination products, FDA stated in the preamble to the final rule that it intended to require combination products (i.e., drug/device and biologic/device combinations) that contain natural rubber device components to be labeled in accordance with Sec. 801.437 (62 FR 51021 at 51026). Because the entities that comprise a combination product meet more than one jurisdictional definition, the agency may apply one or more sets of regulatory provisions to such products, as specified in the Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health and the Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (the Intercenter Agreements). Concerning the implementation of the final rule for these combination products, the FDA stated that natural rubber combination products that are listed in the Intercenter Agreements as being regulated under device labeling provisions will be required to comply with the final rule on the effective date. FDA stated that natural rubber combination products that are listed in the Intercenter Agreements as being regulated under drug or biologic labeling provisions will be subject to the labeling requirements on September 30, 1998, or when FDA amends the Intercenter Agreements to provide that these types of combination products are subject to the requirements, whichever is later. FDA stated that it would provide notice in the Federal Register of the amendments to the Intercenter Agreements to apply the labeling requirements to all natural rubber combination products regulated under drug and biologic provisions. FDA also stated then that: ``the agency anticipates that the Drug/Device Intercenter Agreement will be amended to reflect that prefilled drug vial containers, transdermal patches, infusion pumps, and prefilled syringes that presently are regulated under drug authorities are also subject to this regulation'' (62 FR 51021 at 51026). The agency has received numerous inquiries about, and objections to, the application of the natural rubber labeling requirements to combination drug/device products and to combination biologic/device products that currently are regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions. These include a citizen petition submitted by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (Docket No. 98P-0012/CP1). One concern was that some combination products may raise different labeling issues than single-entity device products. In addition, a concern was raised that adequate notice and opportunity for comment was not provided with regard to the applicability of the rule to combination products that currently are regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions. FDA believes that the notice provided was legally sufficient. However, upon consideration of these comments and the need to provide a uniform labeling approach for all drug and biological products, including combination products currently regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions, FDA has decided that further opportunity for public comment should be provided on how natural rubber labeling requirements should be applied to all products regulated as drugs and biologics. FDA believes that it would benefit from additional public comment on whether there are labeling issues that are unique to products regulated as drugs and biologics as well as on whether the agency should adopt rules and guidance that would apply to all natural rubber-containing products regulated under the drug and biologic labeling provisions rather than only to combination products. Therefore, FDA is announcing that it does not intend to amend the Intercenter Agreements as stated in the preamble to the final rule. Instead, FDA intends to initiate a proceeding to propose requirements for labeling statements on products regulated as drugs and biologics, including combination products currently regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions, that contain natural rubber that contacts humans. Such a proceeding may include a combination of proposed rulemaking and guidance and will offer opportunity for public comment. In the interim, FDA is providing notice that it does not intend to apply to combination products regulated under human drug or biologic labeling provisions its September 30, 1997, final rule requiring certain labeling statements for all medical devices that contain or have packaging containing natural rubber that contacts humans.",63 FR 24934, 98-11982,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1998/05/06/98-11982/natural-rubber-containing-medical-devices-user-labeling,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1998-05-06/pdf/98-11982.pdf,5/6/1998

Food Labeling: Health Claims; Soluble Fiber From Certain Foods and Coronary Heart Disease,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its decision to authorize the use, on food labels and in food labeling, of health claims on the association between soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk and reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Based on its review of evidence submitted with comments to the proposal, as well as evidence described in the proposal, the agency has concluded that soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk, similar to beta (<greek-b>)- glucan soluble fiber from whole oats, when included as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD by lowering blood cholesterol levels. The agency has concluded, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, that there is significant scientific agreement among qualified experts to support the relationship between soluble fiber in psyllium seed husk and CHD. Therefore, the agency has decided to amend the regulation that authorized a health claim on soluble fiber from whole oats and the risk of CHD to include soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk. FDA has determined that label statements alerting consumers to the need to consume adequate amounts of liquids with products containing dry or incompletely hydrated psyllium will be required on products bearing the health claim.

Direct and Secondary Direct Food Additives; Sodium Mono- and Dimethyl Naphthalene Sulfonates,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates as an aid in the steam/scald vacuum peeling of tomatoes without a subsequent potable water wash. This action is in response to a petition filed by Enviro Tech Chemical Services, Inc. In conjunction with this action, the agency is also amending the food additive regulations by broadening a section heading to cover the new application and by removing the redundant cross- reference to a section. DATES: Effective February 12, 1998; written objections and requests for a hearing by March 16, 1998. ADDRESSES: Submit written objections to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Dr., rm. 1-23, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martha D. Peiperl, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-215), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202-418-3077. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1996 (61 FR 11214), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 6A4487) had been filed by Enviro Tech Chemical Services, Inc., P.O. Box 577470, Modesto, CA 95357. The petition proposed to amend the food additive regulations in Sec. 172.824 Sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates (21 CFR 172.824) to provide for the safe use of sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates as an aid in peeling tomatoes without a potable water wash. Sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates are currently approved in Sec. 172.824 as an anticaking agent in sodium nitrite, for use in the crystallization of sodium carbonate intended for use in potable water systems to reduce hardness and aid in sedimentation and coagulation and by cross-reference to Sec. 173.315 Chemicals used in washing or to assist in the lye peeling of fruits and vegetables (21 CFR 173.315), in the washing or to assist in the lye peeling of fruits and vegetables. The subject additive is defined in Sec. 172.824 and, as cross-referenced in Sec. 172.824(b)(3), may be used in the washing or to assist in the lye peeling of fruits and vegetables as prescribed in Sec. 173.315, only when this use is followed by rinsing with potable water to remove, to the extent possible, residues of the chemicals. Therefore, the action requested by this petition is more appropriately addressed by amending Sec. 173.315 to allow the use of the subject additive in the steam/scald vacuum peeling of tomatoes without a subsequent potable water wash. Although only an amendment to Sec. 172.824 was cited in the filing notice for this petition, the action currently being taken was accurately described at that time. In addition, FDA is amending the section heading of Sec. 173.315 by removing the word ``lye.'' This action is being taken to broaden Sec. 173.315 to cover the new application for steam/scald vacuum peeling in addition to lye peeling. This action is simply a technical change because the current limitations continue to be stated in paragraphs (a)(2) and newly redesignated (a)(4). In continuation of FDA's efforts to implement the President's March 4, 1995 ``Reinventing Government'' initiative, FDA is also removing as redundant Sec. 172.824(b)(3), because this paragraph is an unnecessary cross-reference to the regulation of the additive under Sec. 173.315. This action is also a technical change because the approved uses of the subject additive are not changed by virtue of the deletion. FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. As part of its review, FDA evaluated data on the use of the subject additive in peeling tomatoes using steam or scalding water instead of lye, including analytical evidence that no residues of the additive were detected in five production samples of tomato paste prepared from tomatoes treated with the additive prior to peeling, but with no subsequent potable water rinse. Based on this information, as well as certain toxicological data, the agency concludes that the additive will have the intended technical effect and is safe under the proposed conditions of use. Therefore, the agency is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the requested use. In accordance with Sec. 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in Sec. 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. No comments were received during the 30- day comment period specified in the filing notice for comments on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition. Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 16, 1998, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the grounds for the objection.

Substances Prohibited From Use in Animal Food or Feed; Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to provide that animal protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in ruminant feed is a food additive subject to certain provisions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The final rule establishes a flexible system of controls designed to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain animal protein derived from mammalian tissues and to encourage innovation in such controls. FDA is taking this action because ruminants have been fed protein derived from animals in which transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's) have been found. Such proteins may cause TSE's in ruminants. TSE's are progressively degenerative central nervous system diseases of man and other animals that are fatal. Epidemiologic evidence gathered in the United Kingdom suggests an association between an outbreak of a ruminant TSE, specifically bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and the feeding to cattle of protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE. Also, there may be an epidemiologic association between BSE and a form of human TSE known as new variant Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (nv-CJD) reported in England. BSE has not been diagnosed in the United States, and the final rule is intended to prevent the establishment and amplification of BSE in the United States through feed and thereby minimize any risk to animals and humans.",62 FR 30936, 97-14682,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1997/06/05/97-14682/substances-prohibited-from-use-in-animal-food-or-feed-animal-proteins-prohibited-in-ruminant-feed,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1997-06-05/pdf/97-14682.pdf,6/5/1997

Given that the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) has recommended that women of childbearing age consume at least 0.4 milligrams (mg) (400 micrograms (mcg)) of folic acid daily to reduce their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other neural tube defects, FDA encourages firms to initiate the required fortification before the 1998 effective date of the regulations. To facilitate initiation of fortification for firms who elect to voluntarily fortify foods in a manner that is consistent with the new folic acid fortification requirements, the agency is unlikely to enforce the ingredient declaration and nutrition labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to this nutrient until after January 1, 1998.",61 FR 46714, 96-22606,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1996/09/05/96-22606/food-standards-amendment-of-standards-of-identity-for-enriched-grain-products-to-require-addition-of,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-09-05/pdf/96-22606.pdf,9/5/1996
