In response to comments, the Board has amended the proposal to provide that a credit union board must review its succession plan no less than every 24 months, as opposed to the annual review that would have been required under the proposed rule. The Board has also revised the proposed rule by removing loan officers, credit committee members, and supervisory committee members from the list of FICU officials that must be covered by the succession plans. In addition, non-substantive changes have been made to the wording used in the list of covered officials for purposes of clarity. The final rule also streamlines the required contents of the succession plans and no longer requires that deviations from approved succession plans be documented in the FICU board's meeting minutes.

Reconsideration of the Dust-Lead Hazard Standards and Dust-Lead Post-Abatement Clearance Levels,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"As part of EPA's high-priority efforts to reduce childhood lead exposure, and in accordance with a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 2021 opinion, EPA is finalizing its proposal to lower the dust-lead hazard standards to any reportable level as analyzed by a laboratory recognized by EPA's National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP). EPA's lead-based paint (LBP) regulations do not compel property owners or occupants to evaluate their property for LBP hazards or to take control actions, but if a LBP activity such as an abatement is performed, then EPA's regulations set requirements for doing so. EPA is also finalizing changes to lower the post-abatement dust-lead clearance levels to 5 micrograms per square foot ([micro]g/ft\2\), 40 [micro]g/ft\2\, and 100 [micro]g/ft\2\ for floors, window sills and troughs respectively, the current levels in New York City. Due to feedback from public comments, EPA is also finalizing changes to the nomenclature to adopt the terms dust-lead reportable levels (DLRL) and dust-lead action levels (DLAL). Given the decoupling of the action levels from the reportable levels, EPA is finalizing revisions to the definition of abatement so that the recommendation for action based on dust-lead applies when dust-lead loadings are at or above the action levels, rather than the hazard standards, as has been the case historically. The dust-lead hazard standards will be described as DLRL moving forward (i.e., after publication of this final rule) and the dust-lead clearance levels will be described as DLAL.

These final amendments will assure that sources accounting for not less than 90 per centum of the aggregate emissions of each persistent and bioaccumulative hazardous air pollutant (HAP) listed in CAA remain subject to standards promulgated under the CAA, as the Act requires, and will thereby ensure continued health protections from NESHAP that regulate those HAP.

AmeriCorps Seniors Regulation Updates,Rule,Corporation for National and Community Service,"The Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) is revising its regulations governing AmeriCorps Seniors programs. This rule removes barriers to service for individuals and increases flexibility for grantees to accomplish project goals and recruit volunteers. Specifically, this rule removes barriers for individuals to serve as AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers in three ways: first, by modernizing what is considered income in the calculation that determines eligibility to receive a stipend; second, by allowing volunteers to continue to receive a stipend when their sponsor places them on administrative leave due to extenuating circumstances that prevent service; and third, by allowing grantees to supplement stipends. This rule reduces burden for AmeriCorps Seniors grantees in two ways: first, it establishes a single 10 percent match value regardless of grant year. Second, this rule allows grantees to choose to pay more than (but not less than) the AmeriCorps-established stipend rates, using non-AmeriCorps funds for the amount that exceeds the AmeriCorps-established rate. These changes will improve grantees' ability to recruit volunteers and allow grantees to devote to program operations resources that would otherwise be devoted to meet increasingly high match requirements. The rule also updates nomenclature to reflect that the Corporation for National and Community Service operates as AmeriCorps and that ""Senior Corps"" is now known as ""AmeriCorps Seniors.""",89 FR 70536, 2024-19348,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/08/30/2024-19348/americorps-seniors-regulation-updates,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-08-30/pdf/2024-19348.pdf,8/30/2024

Safety Standard for Infant and Cradle Swings,Rule,Consumer Product Safety Commission,"In June 2012, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant swings under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference ASTM F2088-12a, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Infant Swings, the voluntary standard for infant swings that was in effect at the time. Because the standard applied to both infant and cradle swings, in 2020, ASTM changed the title of the voluntary standard by adding cradle swings to the title. ASTM has now issued a revised standard, ASTM F2088-24, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Infant and Cradle Swings. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA update process, this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2024 version of the voluntary standard. It also revises the mandatory standard to include ""cradle swings"" to align with the voluntary standard.",89 FR 46797, 2024-11792,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/30/2024-11792/safety-standard-for-infant-and-cradle-swings,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-05-30/pdf/2024-11792.pdf,5/30/2024

These regulations codify the process by which landowners can request and the Service will provide drain tile setbacks under wetland easement contracts. Under these regulations, if landowners fully comply with Service-provided setbacks when installing drain tile and do not later replace or modify the drain tile, the Service grants the landowners a safe harbor from legal action in the event that the setback drain tile nevertheless results in the draining of an easement wetland. Setback distances are calculated based upon the best available science considering soil characteristics, tile diameter, the depth of the tile below the surface, and/or topography sufficient to the easement contract's standard of protection that ensures no drainage of adjacent protected wetland areas.

In this document, to allow satellite communications on spectrum previously allocated only to terrestrial services, the Commission modifies the United States Table of Frequency Allocations to authorize bi- directional, secondary mobile-satellite service operations in certain spectrum bands that have no primary, non-flexible-use legacy incumbents, Federal or non-Federal. For these bands, we authorize SCS only where one or more terrestrial licensees--together holding all licenses on the relevant channel throughout a defined geographically independent area--lease access to their spectrum rights to a participating satellite operator, whose license reflects these frequencies and the geographically independent area in which they will offer SCS. In recognition that this new offering has the potential to bring life-saving connectivity to remote areas, the Commission also applies interim 911 call and text routing requirements to ensure that help is available to those who need it today while we work toward enabling automatic location-based routing of all emergency communications whether or not there is a terrestrial connection available.",89 FR 34148, 2024-06669,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/30/2024-06669/single-network-future-supplemental-coverage-from-space-space-innovation,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-04-30/pdf/2024-06669.pdf,4/30/2024

The 2018 AHP Rule was a significant departure from the Department's longstanding pre-rule guidance on the definition of ""employer"" under ERISA. This departure substantially weakened the Department's traditional criteria in a manner that would have enabled the creation of commercial AHPs functioning effectively as health insurance issuers.

PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"In March 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed and requested comment on the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) and health-based Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) for six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX Chemicals), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS). After consideration of public comment and consistent with the provisions set forth under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the EPA is finalizing NPDWRs for these six PFAS. Through this action, the EPA is finalizing MCLGs for PFOA and PFOS at zero. Considering feasibility, the EPA is promulgating individual Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS at 4.0 nanograms per liter (ng/L) or parts per trillion (ppt). The EPA is also finalizing individual MCLGs and is promulgating individual MCLs for PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA at 10 ng/L. In addition to the individual MCLs for PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA, in consideration of the known toxic effects, dose additive health concerns and occurrence and likely co-occurrence in drinking water of these three PFAS, as well as PFBS, the EPA is finalizing a Hazard Index (HI) of 1 (unitless) as the MCLG and MCL for any mixture containing two or more of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS. Once fully implemented, the EPA estimates that the rule will prevent thousands of deaths and reduce tens of thousands of serious PFAS-attributable illnesses.",89 FR 32532, 2024-07773,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/26/2024-07773/pfas-national-primary-drinking-water-regulation,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-04-26/pdf/2024-07773.pdf,4/26/2024

Definition of “Engaged in the Business” as a Dealer in Firearms,Rule,"Justice Department; Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau","The Department of Justice (""Department"") is amending Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (""ATF"") regulations to implement the provisions of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that broaden the definition of when a person is considered ""engaged in the business"" (""EIB"") as a dealer in firearms other than a gunsmith or pawnbroker. This final rule incorporates the BSCA's definitions of ""predominantly earn a profit"" (""PEP"") and ""terrorism,"" and amends the regulatory definitions of ""principal objective of livelihood and profit"" and ""engaged in the business"" to ensure each conforms with the BSCA's statutory changes and can be relied upon by the public. The rule also clarifies what it means for a person to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms and to have the intent to ""predominantly earn a profit"" from the sale or disposition of firearms. In addition, it clarifies the term ""dealer"" and defines the term ""responsible person."" These clarifications and definitions assist persons in understanding when they are required to have a license to deal in firearms. Consistent with the Gun Control Act (""GCA"") and existing regulations, the rule also defines the term ""personal collection"" to clarify when persons are not ""engaged in the business"" because they make only occasional sales to enhance a personal collection or for a hobby, or if the firearms they sell are all or part of a personal collection. This rule further addresses the procedures that former licensees, and responsible persons acting on behalf of such licensees, must follow when they liquidate business inventory upon revocation or other termination of their license. Finally, the rule clarifies that a licensee transferring a firearm to another licensee must do so by following the verification and recordkeeping procedures in the regulations, rather than by using a Firearms Transaction Record, ATF Form 4473.",89 FR 28968, 2024-07838,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/19/2024-07838/definition-of-engaged-in-the-business-as-a-dealer-in-firearms,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-04-19/pdf/2024-07838.pdf,4/19/2024

The amendments modify time-to-execution categories and require average time to execution to be measured in increments of a millisecond or finer and calculated on a share-weighted basis for all orders. The amendments require that the time of order receipt and time of order execution be measured in increments of a millisecond or finer, and that realized spread be calculated at multiple time intervals.

This action is consistent with the State Department's addition of Nicaragua to the list of countries that are subject to a U.S. arms embargo under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). To reflect this changed status under the ITAR, BIS adds Nicaragua to Country Group D:5. BIS's amendments also address concerns regarding the Nicaraguan Government's commission of human rights abuses against citizens and civil society groups, as well as the regime's ongoing military and security cooperation with Russia. Specifically, BIS is moving Nicaragua from Country Group B to Country Group D, a more restrictive country grouping, applying a stringent licensing policy for items controlled for national security reasons, and making the country subject to `military end use' and `military end user' restrictions. This rule advances the U.S. Government's efforts to restrict the availability of items subject to the EAR to Nicaragua's military and security services. Additionally, consistent with BIS's authorities under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, this rule demonstrates a commitment to using export controls to protect human rights and promote democracy.",89 FR 18780, 2024-05696,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/15/2024-05696/revisions-to-export-reexport-and-transfer-in-country-controls-for-nicaragua-under-the-export,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-03-15/pdf/2024-05696.pdf,3/15/2024

Location-Based Routing for Wireless 911 Calls,Rule,Federal Communications Commission,"The Federal Communications Commission (the FCC or Commission) adopted a Report and Order in PS Docket No. 18-64, FCC 24-4, on January 25, 2024, and released on January 26, 2024. This document is a summary of the Commission's Report and Order. The Report and Order adopted rules to more precisely route wireless 911 calls and Real-Time Texts (RTT) to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), which can result in faster response times during emergencies. Wireless 911 calls have historically been routed to PSAPs based on the location of the cell tower that handles the call. Sometimes, however, the 911 call is routed to the wrong PSAP because the cell tower is not in the same jurisdiction as the 911 caller. This can happen, for instance, when an emergency call is placed near a county border. These misrouted 911 calls must be transferred from one PSAP to another, which consumes time and resources and can cause confusion and delay in emergency response. The Report and Order requires wireless providers to deploy technology that supports location-based routing, a method that relies on precise information about the location of the wireless caller's device, on their internet Protocol (IP)-based networks and to use location-based routing to route 911 voice calls and RTT communications to 911 originating on those networks when caller location is accurate and timely. The Report and Order provides six months for nationwide wireless providers to implement location-based routing for wireless 911 voice calls and provides 24 months for non-nationwide wireless providers to implement location-based routing of wireless 911 voice calls. The Report and Order provides 24 months for all wireless providers to implement location-based routing for RTT communications to 911.",89 FR 18488, 2024-03157,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/13/2024-03157/location-based-routing-for-wireless-911-calls,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-03-13/pdf/2024-03157.pdf,3/13/2024

Management of Federal Agency Disbursements,Rule,Treasury Department; Fiscal Service,"On January 10, 2023, the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend Fiscal Service's Management of Federal Agency Disbursements rule, which implements a statutory mandate requiring the Federal Government to deliver non-tax payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless Treasury determines that a waiver of the requirement is appropriate. Fiscal Service is now issuing this final rule (Final Rule) to adopt the amendments as proposed, with one minor change. Among other things, the Final Rule strengthens the EFT requirement by narrowing the scope of existing waivers from the EFT mandate or requiring agencies to obtain Fiscal Service's approval to invoke certain existing part 208 waivers. The use of electronic payments has expanded significantly since the waivers from the EFT mandate were first published in 1998, and the Final Rule appropriately updates part 208's waiver provisions, given the broad availability of safe and secure electronic payment options currently available. In doing so, the Final Rule leverages Treasury's growing profile of electronic payment options, which are faster, less expensive, and safer than paper checks. The strengthening of the EFT requirement with these changes is also consistent with Treasury's commitment to reducing check payments.",89 FR 12955, 2024-03204,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/21/2024-03204/management-of-federal-agency-disbursements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-02-21/pdf/2024-03204.pdf,2/21/2024

Taking of Marine Mammals Incidental to Commercial Fishing Operations; Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan Regulations,Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS is amending the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (Plan) to expand the boundaries of the seasonal Massachusetts Restricted Area (MRA) to include the wedge between State and Federal waters known as the Massachusetts Restricted Area Wedge (MRA Wedge). The MRA Wedge was seasonally closed to trap/pot fishing gear by emergency rulemaking in 2022 and 2023 to prevent the immediate risk to the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis, right whale) of mortality and serious injury caused by entanglement in fixed-gear buoy lines. Substantial observational evidence has documented the consistent presence of right whales within the MRA Wedge from February through April and aerial surveys have similarly documented the presence of aggregated fixed gear in the MRA Wedge during this same time period. Due to the co-occurrence of whales and buoy lines, both in high densities in this area during the specified times of year, this entanglement risk is expected to recur annually. This action will address this gap in protection between seasonally closed State and Federal waters and reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of right whales, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in commercial trap/pot fisheries.

The Executive order, therefore, provides that contractors and subcontractors performing on covered Federal service contracts must in good faith offer service employees employed under the predecessor contract a right of first refusal of employment.

The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) jointly issued final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014.

If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. Additionally, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted because the CPI-W decreased, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.
