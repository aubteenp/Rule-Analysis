Food Labeling; Gluten-Free Labeling of Fermented or Hydrolyzed Foods,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is issuing a final rule to establish requirements concerning ""gluten-free"" labeling for foods that are fermented or hydrolyzed or that contain fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients. These requirements f are needed to help ensure that individuals with celiac disease are not misled and receive truthful and accurate information with respect to fermented or hydrolyzed foods labeled as ""gluten- free."" Currently, FDA knows of no scientifically valid analytical method effective in detecting and quantifying with precision the gluten protein content in fermented or hydrolyzed foods in terms of equivalent amounts of intact gluten proteins. Thus, we plan to evaluate compliance of such fermented or hydrolyzed foods that bear a ""gluten-free"" claim based on records that are made and kept by the manufacturer of the food bearing the ""gluten-free"" claim and made available to us for inspection and copying. The records need to provide adequate assurance that the food or ingredients used in the food are ""gluten-free"" before fermentation or hydrolysis. Once we identify that a scientifically valid method has been developed that can accurately detect and quantify gluten in fermented or hydrolyzed foods or ingredients, it would no longer be necessary for the manufacturer of foods bearing the ""gluten-free"" claim to make and keep these records. In addition, because currently there is no scientifically valid analytical method effective in detecting and quantifying the gluten protein content in fermented or hydrolyzed foods the final rule requires the manufacturer of these kinds of foods bearing the ""gluten- free"" claim to document that it has adequately evaluated the potential for gluten cross-contact and, if identified, that the manufacturer has implemented measures to prevent the introduction of gluten into the food during the manufacturing process. Likewise, the final rule requires manufacturers of foods that contain fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients and bear the ""gluten-free"" claim to make and keep records that demonstrate with adequate assurance that the fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients are ""gluten-free"" in compliance with the 2013 gluten-free food labeling final rule. Finally, this final rule states that we will evaluate compliance of distilled foods by verifying the absence of protein using scientifically valid analytical methods that can reliably detect the presence of protein or protein fragments in the distilled food.",85 FR 49240, 2020-17088,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/13/2020-17088/food-labeling-gluten-free-labeling-of-fermented-or-hydrolyzed-foods,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-08-13/pdf/2020-17088.pdf,8/13/2020

Anesthesiology Devices; Reclassification of Membrane Lung for Long-Term Pulmonary Support; Redesignation as Extracorporeal Circuit and Accessories for Long-Term Respiratory/Cardiopulmonary Failure,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final order to redesignate membrane lung devices for long-term pulmonary support, a preamendments class III device, as extracorporeal circuit and accessories for long-term respiratory/cardiopulmonary failure, and to reclassify the device to class II (special controls) in patients with acute respiratory failure or acute cardiopulmonary failure where other available treatment options have failed, and continued clinical deterioration is expected or the risk of death is imminent. A membrane lung device for long-term pulmonary support (>6 hours) refers to the oxygenator in an extracorporeal circuit used during long-term procedures, commonly referred to as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Because a number of other devices and accessories are used with the oxygenator in the circuit, the title and identification of the regulation are revised to include extracorporeal circuit and accessories for long-term respiratory/cardiopulmonary failure. Although an individual device or accessory used in an ECMO circuit may already have its own classification regulation when the device or accessory is intended for short-term use (<=6 hours), such device or accessory will be subject to the same regulatory controls applied to the oxygenator (i.e., class II, special controls) when evaluated as part of the ECMO circuit for long- term use (>6 hours). On its own initiative, based on new information, FDA is revising the classification of the membrane lung device for long-term pulmonary support.",81 FR 7446, 2016-02876,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/02/12/2016-02876/anesthesiology-devices-reclassification-of-membrane-lung-for-long-term-pulmonary-support,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-02-12/pdf/2016-02876.pdf,2/12/2016

"Food Labeling; Nutrient Content Claims, Definition of Sodium Levels for the Term “Healthy”",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations concerning the maximum sodium levels permitted for foods that bear the implied nutrient content claim ""healthy."" The agency is retaining the currently effective, less restrictive, ""first-tier"" sodium level requirements for all food categories, including individual foods (480 milligrams (mg)) and meals and main dishes (600 mg), and is dropping the ""second-tier"" (more restrictive) sodium level requirements for all food categories. Based on the comments received about technological barriers to reducing sodium in processed foods and poor sales of products that meet the second-tier sodium level, the agency has determined that requiring the more restrictive sodium levels would likely inhibit the development of new ""healthy"" food products and risk substantially eliminating existing ""healthy"" products from the marketplace. After reviewing the comments and evaluating the data from various sources, FDA has become convinced that retaining the higher first-tier sodium level requirements for all food products bearing the term ""healthy"" will encourage the manufacture of a greater number of products that are consistent with dietary guidelines for a variety of nutrients. The agency has also revised the regulatory text of the ""healthy"" regulation to clarify the scope and meaning of the regulation and to reformat the nutrient content requirements for ""healthy"" into a more readable set of tables, consistent with the Presidential Memorandum instructing that regulations be written in plain language.",70 FR 56828, 05-19511,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/09/29/05-19511/food-labeling-nutrient-content-claims-definition-of-sodium-levels-for-the-term-healthy,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2005-09-29/pdf/05-19511.pdf,9/29/2005

In the July 14, 2004, interim final rule, FDA designated certain materials from cattle, including the entire small intestine, as ""prohibited cattle materials"" and banned the use of such materials in human food, including dietary supplements, and in cosmetics. FDA is taking this action in response to comments received on the interim final rule. Information was provided in comments that persuaded the agency that the distal ileum, one of three portions of the small intestine, could be consistently and effectively removed from the small intestine, such that the remainder of the small intestine, formerly a prohibited cattle material, could be used for human food or cosmetics. We (FDA) are also clarifying that milk and milk products, hide and hide-derived products, and tallow derivatives are not prohibited cattle materials. Comments also led the agency to reconsider the method cited in the interim final rule for determining insoluble impurities in tallow and to cite instead a method that is less costly to use and requires less specialized equipment. FDA issued the interim final rule to minimize human exposure to materials that scientific studies have demonstrated are highly likely to contain the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent in cattle infected with the disease.

Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an interim final rule (interim final rule) to prohibit the use of certain cattle material, to address the potential risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in human food, including dietary supplements, and cosmetics. Prohibited cattle materials include specified risk materials, small intestine of all cattle, material from nonambulatory disabled cattle, material from cattle not inspected and passed for human consumption, and mechanically separated (MS)(Beef). Specified risk materials are the brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column (excluding the vertebrae of the tail, the transverse processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, and the wings of the sacrum), and dorsal root ganglia of cattle 30 months and older; and the tonsils and distal ileum of the small intestine of all cattle. Prohibited cattle materials do not include tallow that contains no more than 0.15 percent hexane-insoluble impurities and tallow derivatives. FDA is taking this action in response to the finding of an adult cow, imported from Canada, that tested positive for BSE in the State of Washington. This action is consistent with the recent interim final rule issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) declaring specified risk materials and the carcasses and parts of nonambulatory disabled cattle to be inedible, unfit for human food, and prohibiting their use as human food and requiring that the entire small intestine be removed and disposed of as inedible. This action will minimize human exposure to materials that scientific studies have demonstrated are highly likely to contain the BSE agent in cattle infected with the disease. Scientists believe that the human disease variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is likely caused by the consumption of products contaminated with the agent that causes BSE. Also in this issue of the Federal Register, FDA is proposing to require that manufacturers and processors of human food and cosmetics that are manufactured from, processed with, or otherwise contain material from cattle establish and maintain records sufficient to demonstrate that the food and cosmetics are in compliance with this interim final rule.",69 FR 42256, 04-15881,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/07/14/04-15881/use-of-materials-derived-from-cattle-in-human-food-and-cosmetics,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-07-14/pdf/04-15881.pdf,7/14/2004

Bar Code Label Requirement for Human Drug Products and Biological Products,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a new rule to require certain human drug and biological product labels to have bar codes. The bar code for human drug products and biological products (other than blood, blood components, and devices regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) must contain the National Drug Code (NDC) number in a linear bar code. The rule will help reduce the number of medication errors in hospitals and other health care settings by allowing health care professionals to use bar code scanning equipment to verify that the right drug (in the right dose and right route of administration) is being given to the right patient at the right time. The rule also requires the use of machine-readable information on blood and blood component container labels to help reduce medication errors.",69 FR 9120, 04-4249,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/02/26/04-4249/bar-code-label-requirement-for-human-drug-products-and-biological-products,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf,2/26/2004

"Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987; Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992; Policies, Requirements, and Administrative Procedures; Delay of Effective Date",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is further delaying, until December 1, 2006, the effective date of certain requirements of a final rule published in the Federal Register of December 3, 1999 (64 FR 67720). In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of certain requirements in the final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. The agency further delayed the effective date of these requirements in three subsequent Federal Register notices. Most recently, in the Federal Register of January 31, 2003 (68 FR 4912), FDA delayed the effective date until April 1, 2004. This action further delays the effective date of these requirements until December 1, 2006. The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements in the final rule raised by affected parties. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, FDA is working with stakeholders through its counterfeit drug initiative to facilitate widespread, voluntary adoption of track and trace technologies that will generate a de facto electronic pedigree, including prior transaction history back to the original manufacturer, as a routine course of business. If this technology is widely adopted, it is expected to help fulfill the pedigree requirements of the PDMA and obviate or resolve many of the concerns that have been raised with respect to the final rule by ensuring that an electronic pedigree travels with a drug product at all times. Therefore, it is necessary to delay the effective date of Sec. Sec. 203.3(u) and 203.50 (21 CFR 203.3(u) and 203.50) until December 1, 2007 to allow stakeholders time to continue to move toward this goal. In addition, the further delay of the applicability of Sec. 203.3(q) to wholesale distribution of blood derivatives by health care entities is necessary to give the agency additional time to consider whether regulatory changes are appropriate and, if so, to initiate such changes.",69 FR 8105, 04-3856,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/02/23/04-3856/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-02-23/pdf/04-3856.pdf,2/23/2004

"Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987; Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992; Policies, Requirements, and Administrative Procedures; Delay of Effective Date",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is further delaying, until April 1, 2004, the effective date of certain requirements of a final rule published in the Federal Register of December 3, 1999 (64 FR 67720). In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of certain requirements in the final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. The agency further delayed the effective date of these requirements in two subsequent Federal Register documents.

The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements raised by affected parties. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, FDA has prepared a report for Congress and concluded that although FDA can address some of industry's concerns with the PDMA regulation through regulatory changes, other concerns would have to be addressed by Congress through legislative action. The further delay is necessary to give Congress additional time to consider the information and conclusions contained in the agency's report, and to determine if legislative action is appropriate. The further delay will also give the agency additional time to consider whether regulatory changes are appropriate and, if so, to initiate such changes.",68 FR 4912, 03-2293,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/01/31/03-2293/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-01-31/pdf/03-2293.pdf,1/31/2003

Food Labeling: Health Claims; D-tagatose and Dental Caries,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulation authorizing a health claim on sugar alcohols and dental caries, i.e., tooth decay, to include the sugar D-tagatose, a novel food ingredient. Similar to the sugar alcohols currently listed in Sec. 101.80 (21 CFR 101.80), D-tagatose is a carbohydrate sweetener that is slowly fermented by oral microorganisms, thus producing less acid than more fermentable carbohydrates. We (FDA) are taking this action in response to a petition filed by Arla Foods Ingredients amba. We previously concluded that there was significant scientific agreement for the relationship between slowly fermented carbohydrate sugar substitutes, specifically certain sugar alcohols, and the nonpromotion of dental caries. Based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, we now have determined that the sugar D-tagatose, like the sugar alcohols, is not fermented by oral bacteria to an extent sufficient to lower dental plaque pH to levels that would cause the erosion of dental enamel. Therefore, we have concluded that D-tagatose does not promote dental caries, and we are amending the regulation authorizing a health claim relating certain sugar alcohols and nonpromotion of dental caries to include D-tagatose as a substance eligible for the claim. Moreover, because D-tagatose is a sugar, we are denying the petitioner's request to exclude D-tagatose from the definition of ""sugars,"" and instead are exempting foods containing D- tagatose from the requirement that foods bearing a health claim about nonpromotion of dental caries be sugar-free. Accordingly, although products containing D-tagatose will not be permitted to be labeled as ""sugar-free,"" they will be authorized to say that D-tagatose sugar does not promote, or may reduce the risk of, tooth decay.",67 FR 71461, 02-30474,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/12/02/02-30474/food-labeling-health-claims-d-tagatose-and-dental-caries,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2002-12-02/pdf/02-30474.pdf,12/2/2002

In the Federal Register of January 26, 2001 (66 FR 7864), the agency delayed the effective date of the aluminum final rule until January 26, 2003. The aluminum final rule imposes certain requirements for aluminum-containing large volume parenterals (LVPs), small volume parenterals (SVPs), and pharmacy bulk packages (PBPs) used in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). FDA is delaying the effective date of the aluminum final rule to allow time for the agency to finalize an amendment to the aluminum final rule. The agency is also amending the aluminum final rule to change to January 26, 2004, the date that limits the use of historical levels to determine the maximum level of aluminum in SVPs and PBPs; this date corresponds to the effective date of the aluminum final rule, which is delayed until January 26, 2004, by this document.",67 FR 70691, 02-29924,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/11/26/02-29924/aluminum-in-large-and-small-volume-parenterals-used-in-total-parenteral-nutrition-amendment-delay-of,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2002-11-26/pdf/02-29924.pdf,11/26/2002

"Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987; Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992; Policies, Requirements, and Administrative Procedures; Delay of Effective Date",Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is further delaying, until April 1, 2003, the effective date of certain requirements of a final rule published in the Federal Register of December 3, 1999 (64 FR 67720). In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of certain requirements in the final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. In the Federal Register of March 1, 2001 (66 FR 12850), the agency further delayed the effective date of those requirements until April 1, 2002. This action further delays the effective date of these requirements until April 1, 2003. The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements raised by affected parties. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, the delay will allow additional time for Congress and FDA to consider whether legislative and regulatory changes are appropriate. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, FDA has prepared a report for Congress and concluded that although the agency can address some of industry's concerns with the PDMA regulation through regulatory changes, other concerns would have to be addressed by Congress through legislative action. The further delay is necessary to give Congress time to consider the information and conclusions contained in the agency's report, and to determine if legislative action is appropriate. The further delay will also give the agency additional time to consider whether regulatory changes are appropriate and, if so, to initiate such changes.",67 FR 6645, 02-3282,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/02/13/02-3282/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2002-02-13/pdf/02-3282.pdf,2/13/2002

The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). FDA is further delaying the effective date for certain requirements in the PDMA final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ""health care entity"" in the final rule. In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency previously delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of these requirements. The other provisions of the final rule became effective on December 4, 2000. The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements raised by affected parties.

That memorandum requested Federal agencies to delay by 60 days the effective date of any regulation that was not effective as of January 20, 2001. The action taken in this document to further delay the effective date of certain requirements of PDMA exceeds 60 days. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section entitled ""Need to Further Delay the Effective Date,"" the delay will give distributors additional time to exhaust inventories of drugs that do not have acceptable pedigrees to avoid economic harm. Additionally, the delay will allow more time for FDA to make recommendations to Congress, for Congress to evaluate those recommendations and, if necessary, time for a regulatory or legislative change.",66 FR 12850, 01-4964,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/03/01/01-4964/prescription-drug-marketing-act-of-1987-prescription-drug-amendments-of-1992-policies-requirements,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-03-01/pdf/01-4964.pdf,3/1/2001

FDA is taking these actions based on its analysis and consideration of all relevant facts, including its evaluation of the Department of Defense's (DOD) experience during the Persian Gulf War, its evaluation of the comments received by the agency in response to the agency's July 31, 1997, request for comments on whether the agency should revise or revoke the interim regulations, and the enactment of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (the Defense Authorization Act).

Natural Rubber-Containing Medical Devices; User Labeling,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is providing notice that it does not intend to apply to combination products currently regulated under human drug or biologic labeling provisions its September 30, 1997, final rule requiring certain labeling statements for all medical devices that contain or have packaging that contains natural rubber that contacts humans. FDA is taking this action, in part, in response to a citizen petition and other communications from industry that the agency has received since the publication of the final rule. FDA intends to initiate a proceeding to propose natural rubber labeling requirements for drugs and biologics, including combination products that are currently regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions. Such a proceeding may include a combination of rulemaking and guidance and will offer opportunity for public comment. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 30, 1998. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian L. Pendleton, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD- 7), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-594-5649; or Robert A. Yetter, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM-10), Food and Drug Administration, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, 301-827-0737. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 30, 1997 (62 FR 51021), FDA published a final rule to be codified at 21 CFR 801.437 requiring certain labeling statements on medical devices that contain or have packaging that contains natural rubber that contacts humans. The labeling statements alert users that a product contains either dry natural rubber or natural rubber latex, and for products containing natural rubber latex that the presence of this material may cause allergic reactions. The final rule, which becomes effective September 30, 1998, was adopted because natural rubber may cause a significant health risk to persons who are sensitized to natural latex proteins. In response to a comment on the proposed latex labeling regulation (61 FR 32618, June 24, 1996) about the applicability of the requirements to combination products, FDA stated in the preamble to the final rule that it intended to require combination products (i.e., drug/device and biologic/device combinations) that contain natural rubber device components to be labeled in accordance with Sec. 801.437 (62 FR 51021 at 51026). Because the entities that comprise a combination product meet more than one jurisdictional definition, the agency may apply one or more sets of regulatory provisions to such products, as specified in the Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health and the Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (the Intercenter Agreements). Concerning the implementation of the final rule for these combination products, the FDA stated that natural rubber combination products that are listed in the Intercenter Agreements as being regulated under device labeling provisions will be required to comply with the final rule on the effective date. FDA stated that natural rubber combination products that are listed in the Intercenter Agreements as being regulated under drug or biologic labeling provisions will be subject to the labeling requirements on September 30, 1998, or when FDA amends the Intercenter Agreements to provide that these types of combination products are subject to the requirements, whichever is later. FDA stated that it would provide notice in the Federal Register of the amendments to the Intercenter Agreements to apply the labeling requirements to all natural rubber combination products regulated under drug and biologic provisions. FDA also stated then that: ``the agency anticipates that the Drug/Device Intercenter Agreement will be amended to reflect that prefilled drug vial containers, transdermal patches, infusion pumps, and prefilled syringes that presently are regulated under drug authorities are also subject to this regulation'' (62 FR 51021 at 51026). The agency has received numerous inquiries about, and objections to, the application of the natural rubber labeling requirements to combination drug/device products and to combination biologic/device products that currently are regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions. These include a citizen petition submitted by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (Docket No. 98P-0012/CP1). One concern was that some combination products may raise different labeling issues than single-entity device products. In addition, a concern was raised that adequate notice and opportunity for comment was not provided with regard to the applicability of the rule to combination products that currently are regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions. FDA believes that the notice provided was legally sufficient. However, upon consideration of these comments and the need to provide a uniform labeling approach for all drug and biological products, including combination products currently regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions, FDA has decided that further opportunity for public comment should be provided on how natural rubber labeling requirements should be applied to all products regulated as drugs and biologics. FDA believes that it would benefit from additional public comment on whether there are labeling issues that are unique to products regulated as drugs and biologics as well as on whether the agency should adopt rules and guidance that would apply to all natural rubber-containing products regulated under the drug and biologic labeling provisions rather than only to combination products. Therefore, FDA is announcing that it does not intend to amend the Intercenter Agreements as stated in the preamble to the final rule. Instead, FDA intends to initiate a proceeding to propose requirements for labeling statements on products regulated as drugs and biologics, including combination products currently regulated under drug and biologic labeling provisions, that contain natural rubber that contacts humans. Such a proceeding may include a combination of proposed rulemaking and guidance and will offer opportunity for public comment. In the interim, FDA is providing notice that it does not intend to apply to combination products regulated under human drug or biologic labeling provisions its September 30, 1997, final rule requiring certain labeling statements for all medical devices that contain or have packaging containing natural rubber that contacts humans.",63 FR 24934, 98-11982,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1998/05/06/98-11982/natural-rubber-containing-medical-devices-user-labeling,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1998-05-06/pdf/98-11982.pdf,5/6/1998

Food Labeling: Health Claims; Soluble Fiber From Certain Foods and Coronary Heart Disease,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its decision to authorize the use, on food labels and in food labeling, of health claims on the association between soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk and reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Based on its review of evidence submitted with comments to the proposal, as well as evidence described in the proposal, the agency has concluded that soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk, similar to beta (<greek-b>)- glucan soluble fiber from whole oats, when included as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of CHD by lowering blood cholesterol levels. The agency has concluded, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, that there is significant scientific agreement among qualified experts to support the relationship between soluble fiber in psyllium seed husk and CHD. Therefore, the agency has decided to amend the regulation that authorized a health claim on soluble fiber from whole oats and the risk of CHD to include soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk.

DATES: Effective February 12, 1998; written objections and requests for a hearing by March 16, 1998. ADDRESSES: Submit written objections to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Dr., rm. 1-23, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martha D. Peiperl, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-215), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202-418-3077. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1996 (61 FR 11214), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 6A4487) had been filed by Enviro Tech Chemical Services, Inc., P.O. Box 577470, Modesto, CA 95357. The petition proposed to amend the food additive regulations in Sec. 172.824 Sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates (21 CFR 172.824) to provide for the safe use of sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates as an aid in peeling tomatoes without a potable water wash. Sodium mono- and dimethyl naphthalene sulfonates are currently approved in Sec. 172.824 as an anticaking agent in sodium nitrite, for use in the crystallization of sodium carbonate intended for use in potable water systems to reduce hardness and aid in sedimentation and coagulation and by cross-reference to Sec. 173.315 Chemicals used in washing or to assist in the lye peeling of fruits and vegetables (21 CFR 173.315), in the washing or to assist in the lye peeling of fruits and vegetables. The subject additive is defined in Sec. 172.824 and, as cross-referenced in Sec. 172.824(b)(3), may be used in the washing or to assist in the lye peeling of fruits and vegetables as prescribed in Sec. 173.315, only when this use is followed by rinsing with potable water to remove, to the extent possible, residues of the chemicals. Therefore, the action requested by this petition is more appropriately addressed by amending Sec. 173.315 to allow the use of the subject additive in the steam/scald vacuum peeling of tomatoes without a subsequent potable water wash. Although only an amendment to Sec. 172.824 was cited in the filing notice for this petition, the action currently being taken was accurately described at that time. In addition, FDA is amending the section heading of Sec. 173.315 by removing the word ``lye.'' This action is being taken to broaden Sec. 173.315 to cover the new application for steam/scald vacuum peeling in addition to lye peeling. This action is simply a technical change because the current limitations continue to be stated in paragraphs (a)(2) and newly redesignated (a)(4). In continuation of FDA's efforts to implement the President's March 4, 1995 ``Reinventing Government'' initiative, FDA is also removing as redundant Sec. 172.824(b)(3), because this paragraph is an unnecessary cross-reference to the regulation of the additive under Sec. 173.315. This action is also a technical change because the approved uses of the subject additive are not changed by virtue of the deletion. FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. As part of its review, FDA evaluated data on the use of the subject additive in peeling tomatoes using steam or scalding water instead of lye, including analytical evidence that no residues of the additive were detected in five production samples of tomato paste prepared from tomatoes treated with the additive prior to peeling, but with no subsequent potable water rinse. Based on this information, as well as certain toxicological data, the agency concludes that the additive will have the intended technical effect and is safe under the proposed conditions of use. Therefore, the agency is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the requested use. In accordance with Sec. 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in Sec. 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. No comments were received during the 30- day comment period specified in the filing notice for comments on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition. Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 16, 1998, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto.

Substances Prohibited From Use in Animal Food or Feed; Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to provide that animal protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in ruminant feed is a food additive subject to certain provisions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The final rule establishes a flexible system of controls designed to ensure that ruminant feed does not contain animal protein derived from mammalian tissues and to encourage innovation in such controls. FDA is taking this action because ruminants have been fed protein derived from animals in which transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's) have been found. Such proteins may cause TSE's in ruminants. TSE's are progressively degenerative central nervous system diseases of man and other animals that are fatal. Epidemiologic evidence gathered in the United Kingdom suggests an association between an outbreak of a ruminant TSE, specifically bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and the feeding to cattle of protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE. Also, there may be an epidemiologic association between BSE and a form of human TSE known as new variant Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (nv-CJD) reported in England.

Given that the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) has recommended that women of childbearing age consume at least 0.4 milligrams (mg) (400 micrograms (mcg)) of folic acid daily to reduce their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other neural tube defects, FDA encourages firms to initiate the required fortification before the 1998 effective date of the regulations. To facilitate initiation of fortification for firms who elect to voluntarily fortify foods in a manner that is consistent with the new folic acid fortification requirements, the agency is unlikely to enforce the ingredient declaration and nutrition labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to this nutrient until after January 1, 1998.",61 FR 46714, 96-22606,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1996/09/05/96-22606/food-standards-amendment-of-standards-of-identity-for-enriched-grain-products-to-require-addition-of,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-09-05/pdf/96-22606.pdf,9/5/1996
