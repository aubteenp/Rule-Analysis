Medicaid Program and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This interim final rule sets forth the State requirements to provide information to us for purposes of estimating improper payments in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), as required under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002. The IPIA requires heads of Federal agencies to annually estimate and report to the Congress these estimates of improper payments for the programs they oversee and, submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous payments. We published a proposed rule on August 27, 2004 to propose that States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP and report the State-specific error rates to us for purposes of computing the improper payment estimates for these programs. After extensive analysis of the issues related to having States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP, including public comments on the provisions in the proposed rule, we are revising our proposed approach. Our new approach incorporates commenters' suggestions to engage a Federal contractor by contracting with that entity to complete the data processing and medical reviews and calculate the State-specific error rates. Based on the States' error rates, the contractor also will calculate the improper payment estimates for these programs which will be reported by the Department of Health and Human Services as required by the IPIA. This interim final rule sets out the types of information that States would need to submit to allow CMS to conduct medical and data processing reviews on claims made in the fee-for-service (FFS) setting.

Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit; Interpretation,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This final rule modifies or clarifies our interpretations in several areas of the final rule titled ""Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit"" published in the Federal Register on January 28, 2005. First, it clarifies our interpretation of ""entity"", to respond to inquiries we received subsequent to the publication of the Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) final rule on January 28, 2005. We were asked whether a joint enterprise could be considered an ""entity"" under section 1860D-12(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act), for purposes of offering a prescription drug plan (PDP). Our interpretation is discussed in the Supplementary Information section of this final rule. Second, also subsequent to the publication of the Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) final rule on January 28, 2005, we received inquiries from parties about our discussion of the actuarial equivalence standard and the manner in which an employee health plan sponsor could apply the aggregate net value test in the regulatory text of the final rule. Our interpretation is discussed in the ""Provisions"" section of this final rule. In addition, subsequent to publishing the August 3, 2004 proposed rule (69 FR 46684), we received comments on how the late enrollment penalty would be coordinated with the late enrollment penalty for Part B, and whether the one percent penalty would be sufficient to control for adverse selection. We clarify in the Provisions section of this final rule that the example given in the proposed rule, published on August 3, 2004, did not accord with the proposed or final regulatory language because it did not account for the fact that the base beneficiary premium increases on an annual basis. To remedy this error and in response to comments received on the proposed rule, we provide an interpretation that as the base beneficiary premium increases, the late enrollment penalty must also increase, and is in keeping with how the Part B penalty is calculated. Finally, we are providing clarifying language related to transitioning Part D enrollees from their prior drug coverage to their new Part D plan coverage. The Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit final rule will take effect on March 22, 2005.

Medicare Program: Changes to the Medicare Claims Appeal Procedures,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"Medicare beneficiaries and, under certain circumstances, providers and suppliers of health care services, can appeal adverse determinations regarding claims for benefits under Medicare Part A and Part B under sections 1869 and 1879 of the Social Security Act (the Act). Section 521 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Act of 2000 (BIPA) amended section 1869 of the Act to provide for significant changes to the Medicare claims appeal procedures. This interim final rule responds to comments on the November 15, 2002 proposed rule regarding changes to these appeal procedures, establishes the implementing regulations, and explains how the new procedures will be implemented. It also sets forth provisions that are needed to implement the new statutory requirements enacted in Title IX of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).",70 FR 11420, 05-4062,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/03/08/05-4062/medicare-program-changes-to-the-medicare-claims-appeal-procedures,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2005-03-08/pdf/05-4062.pdf,3/8/2005
Medicare Program; Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier Service Areas and Related Matters,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This final rule provides a mechanism for us to expeditiously make changes to the durable medical equipment regional carrier (DMERC) service area boundaries without notice and comment rulemaking. Through this mechanism, we can change the geographical boundaries served by the regional contractors that process durable medical equipment claims through issuance of a Federal Register notice and make other minor changes in the contract administration of the DMERCs. The mechanism provides a method for increasing or decreasing the number of DMERCs, changing the boundaries of DMERCs based on criteria other than the boundaries of the Common Working File sectors, and awarding new contractors to perform statistical analysis or maintain the national supplier clearinghouse. We will publish these changes and their justifications in a Federal Register notice, rather than through notice and comment rulemaking. Although we may change the number and configuration of regional carriers, we are not altering the criteria and factors that we use in awarding contracts. Through this final rule, we are improving the contracting process so that we can swiftly meet the challenges of the changing healthcare industry and address the changing needs of beneficiaries, suppliers, and the Medicare program.",70 FR 9232, 05-3728,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/02/25/05-3728/medicare-program-durable-medical-equipment-regional-carrier-service-areas-and-related-matters,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2005-02-25/pdf/05-3728.pdf,2/25/2005
Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This final rule implements the provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishing and regulating the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. The new voluntary prescription drug benefit program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003 in section 101 of Title I of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173). Although this final rule specifies most of the requirements for implementing the new prescription drug program, readers should note that we are also issuing a closely related rule that concerns Medicare Advantage organizations, which, if they offer coordinated care plans, must offer at least one plan that combines medical coverage under Parts A and B with prescription drug coverage. Readers should also note that separate CMS guidance on many operational details appears or will soon appear on the CMS website, such as materials on formulary review criteria, risk plan and fallback plan solicitations, bid instructions, solvency standards and pricing tools, plan benefit packages. The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare represents a landmark change to the Medicare program that will significantly improve the health care coverage available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006. Generally, coverage for the prescription drug benefit will be provided under private prescription drug plans (PDPs), which will offer only prescription drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA PDs), which will offer prescription drug coverage that is integrated with the health care coverage they provide to Medicare beneficiaries under Part C of Medicare. PDPs must offer a basic prescription drug benefit. MA-PDs must offer either a basic benefit or broader coverage for no additional cost. If this required level of coverage is offered, MA-PDs or PDPs, but not fallback PDPs may also offer supplemental benefits through enhanced alternative coverage for an additional premium. All organizations offering drug plans will have flexibility in the design of the prescription drug benefit. Consistent with the MMA, this final rule also provides for subsidy payments to sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans to encourage retention of employer-sponsored benefits. We are implementing the drug benefit in a way that permits and encourages a range of options for Medicare beneficiaries to augment the standard Medicare coverage. These options include facilitating additional coverage through employer plans, MA-PD plans and high-option PDPs, and through charity organizations and State pharmaceutical assistance programs. See sections II.C, II.J, and II.P, and II.R of this preamble for further details on these issues. The proposed rule identified options and alternatives to the provisions we proposed and we strongly encouraged comments and ideas on our approach and on alternatives to help us design the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in meeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries.",70 FR 4194, 05-1321,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/01/28/05-1321/medicare-program-medicare-prescription-drug-benefit,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2005-01-28/pdf/05-1321.pdf,1/28/2005

We expect that the definition of ""set in advance"" will be addressed definitively before July 7, 2004 in a final rule with comment period, entitled ""Medicare Program; Physicians' Referrals to Health Care Entities With Which They Have Financial Relationships"" (Phase II).",68 FR 74491, 03-31469,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/12/24/03-31469/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-physicians-referrals-to-health-care-entities-with-which-they-have,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-12-24/pdf/03-31469.pdf,12/24/2003
Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"Section 101, subpart 4 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, codified in section 1860D- 31 of the Social Security Act, provides for a voluntary prescription drug discount card program for Medicare beneficiaries entitled to benefits, or enrolled, under Part A or enrolled under Part B, excluding beneficiaries entitled to medical assistance for outpatient prescription drugs under Medicaid, including section 1115 waiver demonstrations. Eligible beneficiaries may access negotiated prices on prescription drugs by enrolling in drug discount card programs offered by Medicare-endorsed sponsors. Eligible beneficiaries may enroll in the Medicare drug discount card program beginning no later than 6 months after the date of enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and ending December 31, 2005. After December 31, 2005, beneficiaries enrolled in the program may continue to use their drug discount card during a short transition period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending upon the effective date of a beneficiary's outpatient drug coverage under Medicare Part D, but no later than the last day of the initial open enrollment period under Part D. Beneficiaries with incomes no more than 135 percent of the poverty line applicable to their family size who do not have outpatient prescription drug coverage under certain programs--Medicaid, certain health insurance coverage or group health insurance (such as retiree coverage), TRICARE, and Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)--also are eligible for transitional assistance, or payment of $600 in 2004 and up to $600 in 2005 of the cost of covered discount card drugs obtained under the program. In most cases, any transitional assistance remaining available to a beneficiary on December 31, 2004 may be rolled over to 2005 and applied toward the cost of covered discount card drugs obtained under the program during 2005. Similarly, in most cases, any transitional assistance remaining available to a beneficiary on December 31, 2005 may be applied toward the cost of covered discount card drugs obtained under the program during the transition period. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will solicit applications from entities seeking to offer beneficiaries negotiated prices on covered discount card drugs. Those meeting the requirements described in the authorizing statute and this rule, including administration of transitional assistance, will be permitted to offer a Medicare-endorsed drug discount card program to eligible beneficiaries. Endorsed sponsors may charge beneficiaries enrolling in their endorsed programs an annual enrollment fee for 2004 and 2005 of no more than $30; CMS will pay this fee on behalf of enrollees entitled to transitional assistance. To ensure that eligible Medicare beneficiaries take full advantage of the Medicare drug discount card program and make informed choices, CMS will educate beneficiaries about the existence and features of the program and the availability of transitional assistance for certain low-income beneficiaries; and publicize information that will allow Medicare beneficiaries to compare the various Medicare-endorsed drug discount card programs.",68 FR 69840, 03-30753,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/12/15/03-30753/medicare-program-medicare-prescription-drug-discount-card,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-12-15/pdf/03-30753.pdf,12/15/2003

Surcharges are increased premiums for late enrollment and for reenrollment. The Medicare Part B premium may be collected by a variety of methods: Paid directly to the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services by the beneficiary; collected as an adjustment to any Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Civil Service Retirement benefits; paid by an employer as part of an annuity package; or, paid by the State for individuals enrolled in a qualifying State Medicaid program.

In addition, this rule updates the codes subject to the physician self-referral prohibition. We also make revisions to the sustainable growth rate and the anesthesia conversion factor. These changes will ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. We are also finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2003 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for CY 2004.

We have become aware that, in some cases, hospitals' recent rate-of-charge increases greatly exceed their rate-of-cost increases. Because there is a time lag between the cost-to-charge ratios from the latest settled cost report and current charges, this disparity in the rate-of-increases for charges and costs results in cost-to-charge ratios that are too high, which in turn results in an overestimation of hospitals' current costs per case. Therefore, we are revising our outlier payment methodology to ensure that outlier payments are made only for truly expensive cases. We also are revising the methodology used to determine payment for high-cost outlier and short-stay outlier cases that are made to Medicare-participating long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) under the long- term care hospital prospective payment system (LTCH PPS). The policies for determining outlier payment under the LTCH PPS are modeled after the outlier payment policies under the IPPS.",68 FR 34494, 03-14492,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/06/09/03-14492/medicare-program-change-in-methodology-for-determining-payment-for-extraordinarily-high-cost-cases,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-06-09/pdf/03-14492.pdf,6/9/2003
Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals: Annual Payment Rate Updates and Policy Changes,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This final rule establishes the annual update of the payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). It also changes the annual period for which the rates are effective. The rates will be effective from July 1 to June 30 instead of from October 1 through September 30, establishing a ""long-term care hospital rate year"" (LTCH PPS rate year). We also change the publication schedule for these updates to allow for an effective date of July 1. The payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this final rule have been determined based on this revised LTCH PPS rate year. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related groups (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and will continue to be effective each October 1. The outlier threshold for July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004, is also derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. In addition, we are making an adjustment to the short-stay outlier policy for certain LTCHs and a policy change eliminating bed-number restrictions for pre-1997 LTCHs that have established satellite facilities and elect to be paid 100 percent of the Federal rate or when the LTCH is fully phased-in to 100 percent of the Federal prospective rate after the transition period.",68 FR 34122, 03-14078,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/06/06/03-14078/medicare-program-prospective-payment-system-for-long-term-care-hospitals-annual-payment-rate-updates,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-06-06/pdf/03-14078.pdf,6/6/2003

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Hospital Conditions of Participation: Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This final rule requires hospitals to develop and maintain a quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program. In the December 19, 1997 Federal Register, we published a proposed rule to revise the hospitals conditions of participation (CoPs). The QAPI CoP was one of the conditions included in the proposed rule. We separated the QAPI CoP from the larger set of hospital CoPs so that it could be published in advance of the remaining CoPs to implement the Administration's initiatives regarding medical errors. QAPI focuses provider efforts on the actual care delivered to patients, the performance of the hospital as an organization, and the impact of treatment furnished by the hospital on the health status of its patients. Specifically, it is important to note that a QAPI is not designed to measure a hospital's quality, but rather a minimum requirement that the hospital systematically examine its quality and implement specific improvement projects on an ongoing basis. State agencies (SAs) during their surveys, review all aspects of a hospital's operations and this review provides a framework in which the SA can assess a hospital's QAPI program. In addition, the QAPI entails all activities required for measuring quality of care and maintaining it at acceptable levels. This typically includes-- [sbull] Identifying and verifying quality-related problems and their underlying cause; [sbull] Designing and implementing corrective action activities to address deficiencies; and [sbull] Following up to determine the degree of success of an intervention and to detect new problems and opportunities for improvement. Performance improvement activities aim to improve overall performance assuming that there is no permanent threshold for good performance. Under performance improvement framework, hospitals will continuously study and improve the processes of healthcare and delivery of service.",68 FR 3435, 03-1293,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/01/24/03-1293/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-hospital-conditions-of-participation-quality-assessment-and,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2003-01-24/pdf/03-1293.pdf,1/24/2003

Medicare Program; Revisions to Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule for Calendar Year 2003 and Inclusion of Registered Nurses in the Personnel Provision of the Critical Access Hospital Emergency Services Requirement for Frontier Areas and Remote Locations,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This final rule with comment period refines the resource-based practice expense relative value units (RVUs) and makes other changes to Medicare Part B payment policy. In addition, as required by statute, we are announcing the physician fee schedule update for CY 2003. The update to the physician fee schedule occurs as a result of a calculation methodology specified by law. That law required the Department to set annual updates based in part on estimates of several factors. Although subsequent after-the-fact data indicate that actual increases were different to some degree from earlier estimates, the law does not permit those estimates to be revised. A subsequent law required estimates to be revised for FY 2000 and beyond. Although we have exhaustively examined opportunities for a different interpretation of law that would allow us to correct the flaw in the formula administratively, current law does not permit such an interpretation. Accordingly, without Congressional action to address the current legal framework, the Department is compelled to announce herein a physician fee schedule update for CY 2003 of -4.4 percent. Because the Department would adopt a change in the formula that determines the physician update if the law permitted it, we have examined how proper adjustments to past data could result in a positive update. The Department believes that revisions of estimates used to establish the sustainable growth rates (SGR) for fiscal years (FY) 1998 and 1999 and Medicare volume performance standards (MVPS) for 1990-1996 would, under present calculations, result in a positive update. The Department intends to work closely with Congress to develop legislation that could permit a positive update, and hopes that such legislation can be passed before the negative update takes effect. Because the Department wishes to change the update promptly in the event that Congress provides the Department legal authority to do so, we are requesting comments regarding how physician fee schedule rates could and should be recalculated prospectively in the event that Congress provides the Department with legal authority to revise estimates used to establish the sustainable growth rates (SGR) and for 1998 and 1999 and the NVPS for 1990-1996. The other policy changes concern: the pricing of the technical component for positron emission tomography (PET) scans, Medicare qualifications for clinical nurse specialists, a process to add or delete services to the definition of telehealth, the definition for ZZZ global periods, global period for surface radiation, and an endoscopic base for urology codes. In addition, this rule updates the codes subject to physician self-referral prohibitions. We are expanding the definition of a screening fecal-occult blood test and are modifying our regulations to expand coverage for additional colorectal cancer screening tests through our national coverage determination process. We also make revisions to the sustainable growth rate, the anesthesia conversion factor, and the work values for some gastroenterologic services. We are making these changes to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. This final rule also clarifies the enrollment of physical and occupational therapists as therapists in private practice and clarifies the policy regarding services and supplies incident to a physician's professional services. In addition, this final rule discusses physical and occupational therapy payment caps and makes technical changes to the definition of outpatient rehabilitation services. In addition, we are finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2002 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for calendar year (CY) 2003. As required by the statute, we are announcing that the physician fee schedule update for CY 2003 is -4.4 percent, the initial estimate of the sustainable growth rate for CY 2003 is 7.6 percent, and the conversion factor for CY 2003 is $34.5920. This final rule will also allow registered nurses (RNs) to provide emergency care in certain critical access hospitals (CAHs) in frontier areas (an area with fewer than six residents per square mile) or remote locations (locations designated in a State's rural health plan that we have approved.) This policy applies if the State, following consultation with the State Boards of Medicine and Nursing, and in accordance with State law, requests that RNs be included, along with a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a physician's assistant, or a nurse practitioner with training or experience in emergency care, as personnel authorized to provide emergency services in CAHs in frontier areas or remote locations.",67 FR 79966, 02-32503,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/12/31/02-32503/medicare-program-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-for-calendar-year,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2002-12-31/pdf/02-32503.pdf,12/31/2002

The changes affect: refinement of resource-based practice expense relative value units (RVUs); services and supplies incident to a physician's professional service; anesthesia base unit variations; recognition of CPT tracking codes; and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists performing screening sigmoidoscopies.

The rule also updates the list of certain services subject to the physician self-referral prohibitions to reflect changes to CPT codes and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes effective January 1, 2002.

The authority for establishing these fee schedules is provided by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which amended the Social Security Act at section 1842(s). Section 1842(s) of the Social Security Act specifies that statewide or other areawide fee schedules may be implemented for the following items and services still subject to the reasonable charge payment methodology: medical supplies; home dialysis supplies and equipment; therapeutic shoes; parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies; electromyogram devices; salivation devices; blood products; and transfusion medicine. This final rule describes changes made to the proposed fee schedule payment methodology for these items and services and provides that the fee schedules for PEN items and services are effective for all covered items and services furnished on or after January 1, 2002. Fee schedules will not be implemented for electromyogram devices and salivation devices at this time since these items are not covered by Medicare. In addition, fee schedules will not be implemented for medical supplies, home dialysis supplies and equipment, therapeutic shoes, blood products, and transfusion medicine at this time since the data required to establish these fee schedules are inadequate.",66 FR 45173, 01-21657,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/08/28/01-21657/medicare-program-replacement-of-reasonable-charge-methodology-by-fee-schedules-for-parenteral-and,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-08-28/pdf/01-21657.pdf,8/28/2001
Medicaid Program; Medicaid Managed Care; Further Delay of Effective Date,Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,"This document further delays the effective date of the final rule with comment period on Medicaid managed care that we published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001 (66 FR 6228). The January 2001 final rule with comment period, if it had taken effect, would have combined most of the regulatory provisions relating to Medicaid managed care into a new part in 42 CFR, and would have implemented Medicaid managed care requirements of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33). In a Federal Register final rule (66 FR 11546) published on February 26, 2001, we delayed the effective date of the January 2001 rule from April 19, 2001 until June 18, 2001.

This document further delays the effective date of the January 2001 final rule from August 17, 2001 until August 16, 2002. In addition, this document gives the public an opportunity to comment on the length of the delay of effective date. These delays were necessary to give newly appointed Department officials the opportunity for further review and consideration of the new regulations. During these delays, we have heard from key stakeholders in the Medicaid managed care program, including States, advocates for beneficiaries, and provider organizations. These stakeholders expressed strong (sometimes opposing) views about the regulation. In particular, concerns were expressed about revisions made in the final rule that were based on public comments we received on the September 29, 1998 proposed rule (63 FR 52022). Other commenters raised concerns about how we chose to implement those provisions in the final rule without further opportunity for public comment. We are publishing in the August 20, 2001 issue of the Federal Register another proposed rule allowing an additional opportunity for public comment on revised Medicaid managed care provisions.",66 FR 43090, 01-20714,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/08/17/01-20714/medicaid-program-medicaid-managed-care-further-delay-of-effective-date,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-08-17/pdf/01-20714.pdf,8/17/2001

Section 1886(j) of the Act authorizes the implementation of a prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units of hospitals.
