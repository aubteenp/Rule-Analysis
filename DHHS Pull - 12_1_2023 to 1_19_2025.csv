Expansion of Buprenorphine Treatment via Telemedicine Encounter,Rule,Justice Department; Drug Enforcement Administration; Health and Human Services Department,"The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services are amending their regulations to expand the circumstances under which practitioners registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration are authorized to prescribe schedule III-V controlled substances approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder via a telemedicine encounter, including an audio-only telemedicine encounter. Under these new regulations, after a practitioner reviews the patient's prescription drug monitoring program data for the state in which the patient is located during the telemedicine encounter, the practitioner may prescribe an initial six-month supply of such medications (split amongst several prescriptions totaling six calendar months) through audio-only means. Additional prescriptions can be issued under other forms of telemedicine as authorized under the Controlled Substances Act, or after an in-person medical evaluation is conducted. This regulation also requires the pharmacist to verify the identity of the patient prior to filling a prescription. The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 generally requires an in- person medical evaluation prior to issuance of a controlled substance prescription. However, this regulation falls under one of the exceptions found within the Ryan Haight Act. Additionally, this regulation does not affect practitioner-patient relationships in cases where an in-person medical evaluation has previously occurred. The purpose of this regulation is to prevent lapses of care by continuing some of the telemedicine flexibilities that currently exist for those patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder.",90 FR 6504, 2025-01049,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-01049/expansion-of-buprenorphine-treatment-via-telemedicine-encounter,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-17/pdf/2025-01049.pdf,01/17/2025

On May 10, 2023, following initial review of the comments received, DEA, jointly with HHS, issued a temporary rule (First Temporary Rule) extending certain exceptions granted to existing DEA regulations in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (COVID-19 PHE). These exceptions were granted in order to avoid lapses in care for patients. In particular, with respect to practitioner-patient relationships formed after the May 11, 2023, expiration of the COVID-19 PHE, the First Temporary Rule extended the temporary exceptions until November 11, 2023. In this second temporary rule, as DEA and HHS continue to consider revisions to the proposed rules set forth in the March 1, 2023 NPRMs and in light of Telemedicine Listening Sessions that DEA hosted on September 12 and 13, 2023, DEA and HHS are further extending such exceptions to existing DEA regulations for new practitioner-patient relationships through December 31, 2024.",88 FR 69879, 2023-22406,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/10/2023-22406/second-temporary-extension-of-covid-19-telemedicine-flexibilities-for-prescription-of-controlled,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-10-10/pdf/2023-22406.pdf,10/10/2023
